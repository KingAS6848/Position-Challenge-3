            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
            such as JavaScript.HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a
            series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
            can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
            content:

            languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and
            directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
            surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do
            not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
            CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
            video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting.

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
            than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
            type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
            validation service for CSS documents.[5]
            "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
            In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the
            markup itself.

            Selectors may apply to the following:

            all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
            elements specified by attribute, in particular:
            id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
            class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix e.g.
            .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified
            with the HTML class attribute—is a feature of HTML that is distinct from the work on browsers'
            presentational styling subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and
            microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)
            elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
            Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
            and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to
            a single element.

            Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in
            the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when
            the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a
            selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or
            :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as
            ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements versus single-colon
            notation for pseudo-class.

            Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors
            may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination
            thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all
            elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all
            div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated
            identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.

            The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that
            introduced it.[8]

        <P>
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
            on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
            In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard
            specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first
            ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

            The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and
            ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20]

            Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s,
            Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for
            client-side scripting on the Web.

            Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript
            language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.
